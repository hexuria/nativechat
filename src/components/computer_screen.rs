//! The coworker's screen (noVNC) in its own window. macOS only: the page is a
//! `wry` WebView laid over the GPUI window; other platforms never build this.
//!
//! The window has a strip of its own above the screen — the WebView is a
//! native child view, so nothing GPUI draws can sit on top of it — with the
//! "Teach a task" control, Open the screen **Needs your attention** (Skip /
//! I'm done) when a handoff is live, and it answers the window keys itself:
//! ⌘W and ⌘Q close this window only, ⌘M minimizes it, ⌘H hides the app.
//!
//! A stopped tape is written to disk and offered on a sheet under the title bar: named, and told
//! which of three things to become, it goes up as a recipe (`POST /recipes`) or as a skill
//! (`POST /skills/from-tape`, where a model reads it into prose). The third outcome is offered
//! and says plainly that it cannot be made yet; see [`TeachOutcome`] for what it is missing.
//!
//! THE SERVER KEEPS NO TAPE. It takes one, makes what it was asked for, and keeps what it made,
//! so this window holds the only copies there are: the events on the sheet and the file
//! [`save_tape`] wrote. A refusal therefore leaves the tape where it is and offers to send it
//! again — a recording is minutes of somebody's work, and pressing Teach a task twice does not
//! get it back.

/// cannot be made says so on the sheet instead of being quietly unavailable.
///
/// A RECIPE and a SKILL are made from one recording by two different routes, and they are not
/// two names for one thing: a recipe replays the clicks, a skill is the lesson a model writes
/// from watching them. The sheet is the one screen in the app where somebody has to tell the two
/// apart, which is what every word on it is for.
///
/// WHAT THE THIRD IS WAITING FOR, precisely:
///
/// - A WORKFLOW is a decision tree. The server stores and walks one now (`POST /workflows`), and
///   it takes a TREE — named steps, branches, a question for Jev at each fork. A tape is none of
///   that: it is a list of clicks with nothing in it that ever decided anything, and no filter
///   turns one into the other. It needs either something that proposes a tree from a recording,
///   or an editor in this app to write one by hand. Sending a one-step tree that only plays the
///   recipe would be a workflow in name — a tape with a longer route to the same box — which is
