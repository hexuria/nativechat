//! The account's events stream: the server's word, as it happens, that something the app shows
//! has changed (`GET /ag-ui/events`, opengrok-server #348, shaped from its branch
//! account-events-stream @ 85ce00c: `Note` in `crates/opengrok-wire/src/events.rs`, `follow` in
//! `crates/opengrok-events/src/follow.rs`; not recorded yet).
//!
//! Before it, the app heard live only about the turns it started itself, down their own
//! `POST /ag-ui` streams. A run the server started (a routine's clock, a webhook, Test run, a
//! Bot's `run_routine`) reached the open thread and the open Run history only when the person
//! left and came back (hexuria/nativechat#171). The stream carries ids and nothing else, which
//! thread, run, routine and Bot changed, never a word of what was said: the app reads again what
//! a note names, through the doors it already reads those by, so a note dropped or coalesced costs
//! one more read and never a lost message.
//!
//! Frames are SSE: `id: <n>`, `event: <name>`, `data: <one line of JSON>`, and a `: ping` comment
//! every fifteen seconds. The stream is opened again after it drops, with the last id it carried
//! as `Last-Event-ID`, and the server replays what came after it; an id it no longer holds is
//! answered with `reset` first, which has the app read everything again. Ids only go up, and skip:
//! the server sends a burst of a thread's notes as its last, so a gap between two ids is no note
//! lost. The id is kept as the text it came as and handed back, never counted. The stream is the
//! account's, taken from the session, so it is opened with the bearer every other account route
//! goes with, and a `401` goes through the session's own refresh before anything else.
